2.2:

* Change layout of the chroot. THIS REQUIRES USER INTERVENTION. It's safer on
  some systems to have the chroot root directory be unwritable by the chrooted
  user. Please refer to UPGRADING for instructions (including an easy-to-modify
  shell script recipe).
* Support Hurricane Electric dynamic DNS and IPv6 tunnel updates.
* Don't kill the daemon on cURL errors. It's disruptive now that multiple
  services can be updated from a single daemon.
* Enable SSL certificate CA signature verification by default.
* Allow HTTP authentication methods other than plaintext. These are all
  irrelevant when SSL is used (which is necessary for real security), but
  there's no real reason to disallow other methods.
* Disable cURL protocols other than HTTP or HTTPS.
* Use POSIX clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) rather than time().
* Use nanosleep() instead of sleep().
* Lots of cosmetic reorganization and cleanups for maintainability.
* Change license to 2-clause BSD.

2.1:

* Fix a bug in the configuration file parser that could lead to the data
  structures not being filled correctly in some configurations.
* Pedantic corrections to more strictly comply with the C standard.

2.0:

* Change configuration file format.
* Add support for Namecheap DNS service.
* Allow most options previously requiring command line switches to be specified
  in the configuration file.
* Be much more flexible about whitespace in the configuration file.

1.16:

* Support parsing of configuration files passed in through standard input.
* Parse configuration files before forking into the background as a daemon.
* Change license to GPL3.
