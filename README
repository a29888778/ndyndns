If anyone whines about my use of "goto" in this library, know that it is used
so that error handling can be easily audited as being correct, so that error
handling does not unnecessarily clutter the main codepath, and so that it is
easy to properly unwind multiple function side effects cleanly.  The use of
goto in this library is little more than a hand-crafted duplication of the
exception mechanisms present in more powerful languages (cf. ML).

Anyone who emails me to complain about the use of "goto" because their
undergrad CS professor decried its use in class will have their email
ignored, and will likely have found a quick path into my killfile.
