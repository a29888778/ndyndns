If you are upgrading from ndyndns 1.x to 2.x, then it will be necessary
to update your configuration file.

At the minimum, add a line to the top of your config file:

[dyndns]

Then, replace any "hostname=" lines with "hosts=".

That is sufficient for a minimal conversion.  The new format is quite a
bit more flexible, and may allow you to no longer rely on command line
switches if you so wish; I encourage you to read the documentation to
see the new changes.
