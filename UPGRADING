If you are upgrading from ndyndns 2.1 to a later version, then it will be
necessary to update your chroot directory.  The following assumes your ndyndns
daemon runs as user:group ndyndns:ndyndns.

chown root.root $CHROOTDIR
chmod 755 $CHROOTDIR
mkdir $CHROOTDIR/var
chown ndyndns.ndyndns $CHROOTDIR/var
chmod 700 $CHROOTDIR/var
mv $CHROOTDIR/*-dns* $CHROOTDIR/var

In other words, move the dns state files to a new directory $CHROOTDIR/var.
Change permissions on the $CHROOTDIR to be owned by root, and read-executable
for the ndyndns user and group.  Make $CHROOTDIR/var owned by ndyndns user
and group, and allow only the ndyndns user and group to read, write, and
execute to that directory and the files within it.

It's possibly more secure to have the root directory of the chroot be
owned by root, hence the change.

=======================================================================
If you are upgrading from ndyndns 1.x to 2.x, then it will be necessary
to update your configuration file.

At the minimum, add a line to the top of your config file:

[dyndns]

Then, replace any "hostname=" lines with "hosts=".

That is sufficient for a minimal conversion.  The new format is quite a
bit more flexible, and may allow you to no longer rely on command line
switches if you so wish; I encourage you to read the documentation to
see the new changes.
